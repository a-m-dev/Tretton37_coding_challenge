    "mainText": "<p>My son (4 years of age) keeps asking me \"Daddy what do you do?\" and my answer is mostly \"well son, I work with people\" and the response is \"Ok, but what do you do?\". The truth is that I'm a jack of many trades but the one thing in common with everything I do is people. I have been working with people, for people, all my life. It started with selling freshly caught trout to elderly people in my neighbourhood during high school, as they rarely got the chance to get their hands on some.</p><p>In my mid-twenties, I counted all the things I had done at that time and realised that I had experienced over 20 professions varying from the odd construction gigs to bakery assistant to restaurant chef - I even cleaned public transport vehicles during nights in Helsinki while studying arts. That pretty much defines me both professionally and personally - I have never shied away from new things, responsibility or tasks of any kind, as long as I sensed that there is a possibility to learn something on the way. Good or bad, I find ways to enhance my understanding of myself, my surroundings and of people. Later on in life, I learned to channel this and found myself in a leadership role in a company that works for people and with people in distress, and here I found something that felt right. A role that was ever-changing and evolving, a role where you get challenged every day and foremost get to learn stuff and at the same time get to support and help your colleagues in their respective quests. I have been on this track for a decade now and not regretted a second of it, and now I can finally make sense of it to my kid: \"well son, Daddy is a ninja\" and my son replies \"wauu that's so cool Daddy, I want to be a ninja too, like kung-fu panda\". If my story does not point out what gives me most satisfaction in my job, here it comes: Learning, growing and having fun while doing it. </p><p>I'm a naturally curious person and I'm interested in learning more about the business that we operate in, all aspects of it and as much as possible for for someone who never really got around to delving into the deeper aspects of technology, but always enjoyed the benefits that it has brought us. When not dabbling in human understanding or enhancing my knowledge base professionally, you might find me at some obscure river or lake somewhere gathering my thoughts and trying to become a l33t fisherman. I am also very found of reading - especially historical fiction or fantasy in my spare time.</p>  ",

However, during my high school years I started to develop a keen interest for both the mathematical and the social sciences and all of a sudden, it was not so easy for me to decide what area to pursue after high school.</p><p>Finally, I ended up with a Bachelor degree in Mathematics with a specialisation in numerical analysis. Even though I had fallen head over heels in love with mathematics and programming, I was still wondering if I had made the right choice. </p><p>I decided that the only way to figure out what I truly wanted to do for the rest of my life was to try and see what the other side had to offer. I began working in the service and banking industry for a couple of years while giving law school a try. I found law to be a fascinating subject on its own, but realised after some time that my heart truly belonged to mathematics and software development.</p><p>Besides the problem solving skills I developed during my time studying mathematics, I truly believe that my non-traditional background is one of the greatest strengths I possess. I dare say that I have truly lived outside the box, and have thus gained experiences that will benefit me to a great extent, both as an individual but also in my work as a developer.</p><p>In my free time, when I'm not tinkering with Haskell and other functional languages, you can find me outside running long distances or inside working my way through my ever growing \"books-to-read\" list.</p>  ",

My toolbox for attempting to achieve this lofty dream has its origins in web development, Java and subsequently basically anything I've managed to get my hands on. I'm a firm proponent for developers having many different tools in their belt.</p><p>As a person I am thoroughly interested in all things tech. But when I'm not thinking or working with tech, you will usually find me somewhere completely different: Either cooking, listening to music, reading, working on my house (and pretending to know what I'm doing) or laughing (I'm a Monty Python nut). I enjoy so many things besides tech that listing them all would be ridiculous, instead I urge any and all to instead strike up a conversation - perhaps over coffee?</p>  ",

I, like many others my age, owned a Commodore 64 and my family was one of the first to have a PC amongst my friends growing up. Although – out of curiosity - I had picked computers apart, or gone on a mission to down the operating systems in the more stubborn of them, I never thought of doing anything real with that curiosity.</p> <p>Years later, after having worked mainly in the home care sector, I finally decided to go back to school. I felt that I needed to find something to sink my teeth into intellectually that would also allow me to be creative. So, one day I sat myself down with an educational catalogue, and decided to try out a web-development program that looked interesting. That decision turned out to be a real turning point, as programming is perfect for someone like me. It provides me with both a mental challenge as well as a blank canvas that allows vast possibilities for creative expression. I prefer to work the full-stack with either C# or JAVA, as well as working with JavaScript in various forms. I find UX-design to be really fun and interesting – it’s a universe of it’s own. One of the things that I love about working as a full-stack developer, is that it brings a sort of autonomy to me as a developer. I’m able to follow a project through from all the way at the back to the very front.</p><p>When I’m not working, I spend most of my time with my family and friends. I have two small children and one that’s almost a grown up. I love to go out dancing when I can find the time, or engage in different creative projects; such as refurbishing a piece of old furniture I have found in some flea market, or taking a trip down to the woods to make a campfire.</p>  ",

They were about HTML, and even one post was about the then just invented language Javascript. I was about 12 or 13 and the Internet had started to gain mainstream momentum. The dot-com bubble was building up. It would burst in March 2000, and I would give up on programming long before that, I just didn't know that while writing those posts.</p><p>It felt like I had to wait a million years to get computer access at home. To stand the waiting, I started collecting computer magazines, bringing the attached floppies and later CD-ROM's over to friends with computers to see what they contained. These magazines also used to provide simple guides on various topics, one of those happened to be HTML. I had to memorize the tags so that I could test them out by entering them in notepad.exe on the demo systems at my local Lap Power dealership.</p><p>I was 11 when I got my hands on a screaming fast multi media monster (Pentium MMX) at home, a year later, a Telia 020 dialup connection completed the setup. It gave me everything I ever wished for. At this point, I knew very well how to abuse the <marquee> HTML tag and quickly managed to set up Geocities hosting.</marquee></p><p>The Internet was very different back then. It provided me with a safe space during my years in secondary school. I even OP'd a successful channel on DALnet during those years. I never really got the hang of how the Perl scripts on Matt's Script Archive worked or what Dim meant in Visual Basic. I wanted to, but my interest had already started to shift to movie making.</p><p>In my later teens, I tried my best preparing for a career in film making. It proved to be difficult, being based in a small town far away from the industry didn't exactly help. To me, it made little sense to move just to Stockholm. If relocation was going to be required, why not move even further away. That's how I ended up in the Netherlands and how I began my exploration of north-west Europe. Brussels, Belgium was to follow, and before finally ending up in Stockholm, I spent ten years in Hamburg, Germany.</p><p>I think it was in the Netherlands that I got my first VPS, I was a bit afraid at first, as it didn't come with a full-blown desktop environment that I had come to expect from my time using Red Hat Linux 5.2 (not REHL, much older). I slowly started to figure out how the command line worked, and with time people would actually pay me to do system administration for them. One thing bothered me, though, while I was confident in configure and run applications, I could still not fully understand how something was working by reading its source code.</p><p>After doing Sysadmin, I developed a passion for programming. I remember, for years, all I did was study programming. I lived and breathed programming. I didn't even follow the news during these years, it's as if they didn't exist.</p><p>I now work as a Devops, making good use of the experiences that led me to this position.</p>  ",

During my almost 14 years of experience in the field, I’ve seen how trends in web development come and go. </p><p>I started my professional career at the United Nations with a case study of workflows within Content Management Systems, and I was quickly drawn to the .NET environments and how the architectural concepts went through all layers of a CMS. As the web evolved so did I; Visual Studio, C# andMSSQL all quickly became standard tools in my developer toolbox. Later I also acquired an EpIServer CMS certificate and moved forward with more complex architectures.</p><p>In 2008 I moved to Cape Town, South Africa and decided to try and make a change in people's day-to-day lives by offering my services for free to local grassroots organizations. After doing this for almost 2 years, I started work with an EpiServer partner and dug further into the .NET world including REST APIs and Web Services. I did stay a bit longer than intended in South Africa as I met my wife there and we now share 2 beautiful kids that take up most of my free time. </p><p>In 2015 I jumped on the cloud wagon and started developing cloud applications in both Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure.

I loved taking electronics apart and occasionally putting them back together again, and as a child I dreamed of becoming an electrician. At the end of the nineties we got a “home-pc” with an ADSL-connection, and my spare time was spent between either playing Counter Strike &amp; MMORPGs with friends, or playing guitar and drums in a myriad of different school bands.</p><p>My love of all things tech-related, together with my decent problem solving skills, meant that I took on the role as unofficial support technician - whether it concerned audio problems for fellow musicians, or IT-related issues for friends and extended family. At high school I had my first interactions with basic html &amp; css web design and C# programming.</p><p>Shortly after high school, I landed a job as an audio/video technician &amp; project manager for conferences and live events. This allowed me to delve deeper into the art of solving tech-related problems for clients for a living - oh the joy! This meant putting together my optimal mix of tech and people to help clients achieve their goals in the best possible way. I spent five years in this profession before feeling the urge to branch out and take a new career path. Two years later, and with a diploma in complex IT sales, I find myself a part of the magnificent tretton37 family of driven problem solvers and skilled software developing craftsmen.</p><p>While I might not have pursued my early impressions of web and software development, I’ve focused instead on finding synergies between people, business and technology. Today, tretton37 presents me with the opportunity to continue on my tech-related problem solving path. This involves matching clients’ complex problems with the best team possible for creating well thought out, handcrafted solutions - always with world class user experiences and a proven business value top of mind.</p><p>My spare time these days still involves playing and writing music, by myself or with my band. I also enjoy travelling with my girlfriend or going out for a nice dinner with friends. Oh - and did I mention that I still love playing computer and video games? :)</p> ",

As the interview time came i was still unsure of myself but they believed in me and that I am good enough. They saw something more. And now I am here. Part of the amazing company. No not a company but a family.</p><p>From my beginings with frontends and AngularJS to react and node I live and breathe the JavaScript stack. I am most fond of node and backend frameworks but the more I see and use react the more I want to explore it more. Now that i have the freedom to explore i also wish to expand my horizons and skills with docker and serverless.</p><p>Now I reflect on where I came from and where I’m going. the future is bright. Brighter than it ever was and I am excited every day when I wake up to start and create something beautiful for me and others to enjoy.</p><p>But development is not the only thing big in my life. Cycling has also been a big part of my life and still is. Without it I would not be where I am now. It gave me many values that I also search in others.

All my friends were heavily into playing computer games at that time, but since I proved to be a pretty crappy gamer, I started to explore programming instead, and have not stopped since.</p><p>I immediately fell in love with the way I could be creative and playful, learn things and challenge myself at the same time. Pretty quickly I got involved in the so-called demo scene (a sub culture for showing off your artistic and programming skills) and started to create so-called computer demos with my team, competing against others teams at demo parties. Our team consisted of people from all over Sweden, and even other countries. In retrospect I realise that, as young teenagers we were working on projects together in self-organising distributed teams. We were using the ways of remote communication available at the time, which was the telephone, letters with floppies and sometimes modems. All of this gave me some really valuable lessons that proved to be essential throughout my work life. What happened to the demo scene and the team? Well, we are still doing things together, on Commodore 64, Amiga and other retro platforms, going to demo parties and competing with other teams.</p><p>Working with software engineering gives me a perfect mix of creativity and structure. The feeling when you create something of value with your team, or solve a complex problem together is awesome. I believe strongly in the ability of people working together in a playful manner, to make bits and bytes come to life. It gives me a great feeling when I see people helping each other out and learning together. To coach people to learn, explore and push their abilities further is something I want to dive deeper into in the future.</p><p>Outside of the office, I enjoy spending as much time as I can with my wife and daughter, meeting friends, and occasionally enjoying a good run.

But not finding any courses I studied system administration instead. Alas it was not for me.</p><p>Finally I found KY and a vocational education in application development at Lernia Malmö.It was like finding home.​The rest of my professional story up til this day is easier to decipher on LinkedIn.</p><p>Having told you about my technical/professional road here, I feel I should tell you a little about who and what I am outside work.I am married to a wonderful woman and we have 4 lovely children.

I would say that service is my super power and I am happy to perform my service skills here at tretton37.</p><p>My family is of course my number 1 priority and travel is our passion. We are always planning that next trip. I am an enthusiastic sportsparent and I constantly chase my personal best at running a swedish mile. I like to be busy, surrounding myself with nice people and things to do. But I am also learning to enjoy the small things that brings you a happy life!</p>  ",

It is obvious that the latest cycle we have encountered is the technological revolution, and the essence of technology is software.</p><p>It really excites me to have a profession related to the driving force of the twenty-first century. Today, thanks to millions of applications, life is easier than ever before and people have more time to spend on the things they really love to do. It’s satisfying to know that as an Android developer at tretton37, I am able to contribute to making lives simpler. I also really love to code, so it’s a win-win.</p><p>Before telling you what I do in my spare time, you should know that I’m in love with my computer and we are very happy together! I could play games for hours nonstop. However, after my wife yells at me to stop playing games, I like to go out to discover new and exciting tastes with her. We love to go on new adventures/travels that broaden our horizons and allow us to experience something unique and special. </p> ",
